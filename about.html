                <p> Healthy eating wasnâ€™t always our second nature. Little did we know about it back then, in the tiny Hungarian town where we grew up.  We indulged in food that was prepared with love but without regard for the environment.  We are proud of our abundant gastronomical heritage but we also realise that we have to take responsibility for our fellow humans, animals and nature when making food choices.  In addition to our ethical viewpoint, we have also had to make dietary changes in our own lives due to autoimmune disease and this is why everything we prepare and serve will always be gluten-free. </P>
                <p>Our goal is to serve simple, natural, planet-friendly and nutritious food without compromising on flavour.</p>
                <p>Gluten-free grains are the central components of our dishes.  We compliment them with wholesome, plant-based ingredients and homemade delights to create complete meals.  We take our culinary inspiration from our ancestors and the countries and cultures that have shaped our personalities.</p>
                <p>We source most of our ingredients from organic sources and aim to create as little waste as we can to leave the smallest possible footprint on our planet.</p>
                <p> Above all, we serve food that we love to eat. </p>
